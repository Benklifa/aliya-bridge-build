    {
      question: "How does currency hedging work for Aliyah planning?",
      answer: "Currency hedging involves using financial instruments to protect against adverse exchange rate movements between USD and ILS. We implement strategies like forward contracts, currency-hedged investments, and maintaining assets in both currencies to reduce exposure to volatility."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I maintain dual-country bank accounts?",
      answer: "Yes, maintaining accounts in both countries is typically beneficial for currency flexibility, easier bill payment, and avoiding international transfer fees. We help structure this to comply with reporting requirements in both jurisdictions."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I apply for Medicare and how does it work with Israeli healthcare?",
      answer: "You should apply for Medicare Part A when eligible (usually at 65) even if living in Israel, as there's no penalty. Part B has enrollment deadlines that can result in lifetime penalties, so timing is crucial based on your specific situation and health insurance coverage."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 10-year Israeli tax exemption and how do I optimize it?",
      answer: "New and returning residents may qualify for a 10-year exemption on foreign income and capital gains. This creates significant tax planning opportunities for investment timing, Roth conversions, and asset reallocation that we help coordinate with your overall financial plan."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the best liquidity strategies for cross-border living?",
      answer: "Effective liquidity strategies include establishing a HELOC before moving (easier to qualify as a U.S. resident), asset-based lending against investment portfolios, and permanent life insurance policy loans. Each provides access to capital without triggering taxable events."
